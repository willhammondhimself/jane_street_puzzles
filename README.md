### 1. Robot Javelin

*   **Date Added:** December 10, 2025
*   **Problem:** In the Robot Javelin competition, two robots make a throw with a distance uniformly drawn from `[0, 1]`. Each robot can then choose to either keep their first throw or discard it and take a second throw, which they must keep. The robot with the larger final distance wins. A challenger, Spears Robot, has an information leak: they know if your robot's (Java-lin's) first throw was above or below a threshold `d` of their choosing. Assuming Spears chooses `d` optimally, and Java-lin adjusts its strategy in response, what is Java-lin's final win probability?
